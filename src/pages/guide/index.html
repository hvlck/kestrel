        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>
            Kestrel is a collection of utilities for the browser, combined into
            a command palette. But of course, since you're already here, you
            know that already (and if you don't,
            <a href="https://ethanjustice.github.io/taita/">here's</a> a demo
            from the library that powers Kestrel). Let's talk about upgrading
            your browser experience.
        </p>
        <h2>Using Kestrel</h2>
        <p>
            Kestrel is activated by holding <kbd>Alt+Shift+A</kbd> (this can be
            changed - see
            <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manage-extension-shortcuts-firefox">here</a>). This order was
            chosen as it is easily able to be activated using
            a single hand, doesn't conflict with any preexisting shortcuts. Once
            it's open, it'll look something like the image below (of course, the
            colour theme may be different).
        </p>
        <img src="../media/command-palette.png" loading="lazy" />
        <p>
            To close it again, just use the same shortcut as before:
            <kbd>Alt+Shift+A</kbd>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Commands can be filtered by typing into the command palette, and can
            be activated by pressing enter on the currently highlighted command
            (which is a different colour from the others) or clicking it.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's all there is to Kestrel. It's a simple, efficient, and
            functional tool, to help efficient people.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to further customize Kestrel by choosing a theme,
            enabled commands, or another option, head over to the
            <a href="../settings/index.html">settings</a> page.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also see what commands do by visiting the
            <a href="https://github.com/EthanJustice/kestrel/wiki/Commands">commands wiki</a> page.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want in on ongoing development or want to check out what's
            next, view Kestrel's
            <a href="https://github.com/EthanJustice/kestrel/">readme</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are also some caveats to know about, and you can read about
            them <a href="https://github.com/EthanJustice/kestrel/wiki/Caveats">here</a>.
        </p>

            about using, contributing to, and learning Kestrel.
